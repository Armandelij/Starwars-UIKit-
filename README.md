## Success
- Created a TableVIew
- Created a NavigationController
- Created a View Controller that would display the height of each starwars character. 
- Was able to get the JSON downloaded using the getAPI() function. The function will print success in the debugger if the data was downloaded

## Failures

failed to display the data on the screen. Could not get to the properties inside of the [Results] array which would allow me to store the nessesary text
in the TableView Controller
